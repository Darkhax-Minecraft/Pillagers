This mod will slightly tweak villagers so that they sometimes drop a random trade item when killed. When killed by a player, there is a 5% chance that they will drop a trade item. The chance of getting a loot drop goes up by 1.5% for every level of looting used. This drop will only happen if the villager is killed by a player. This drop can not be farmed by most mob grinder/spike blocks. 

The following is a list of things that can be configured

- The base % chance of a villager dropping loot.
- The additional % chance bonus that one level of looting adds.
- Whether or not fake players like mob grinders or spikes are excluded.
